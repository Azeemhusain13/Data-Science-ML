# Robot Movement Simulation

## Overview
This project simulates a robot navigating through a warehouse from a starting position to a destination. The simulation is implemented in Python using Matplotlib for visualization and NumPy for calculations.

## Features
- Visualization of the robot's path in a 10x10 warehouse.
- Adjustable robot speed and update interval for smooth animation.
- Clear representation of the start and end positions.

## Files Included
- `robot_movement_simulation.py`: The main Python code for simulating the robot's movement.
- `robot_movement_presentation.pptx`: A PowerPoint presentation explaining the code, including outputs.
- `README.md`: Documentation for the project.

## Requirements
To run the simulation, you'll need:
- Python 3.x
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

You can install the required libraries using pip:

pip install matplotlib numpy
