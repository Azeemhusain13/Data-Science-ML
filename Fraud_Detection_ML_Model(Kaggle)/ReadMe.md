Fraud Detection
This project involves building a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions using a dataset provided by Kaggle. The model aims to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent based on various transaction features.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is available on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chitwanmanchanda/fraudulent-transactions-data/data

Key Features
Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, outliers, and multicollinearity to prepare the dataset for training.
Model Development: Used a Random Forest classifier for fraud prediction, focusing on imbalanced classification metrics.
Feature Importance: Identified key predictors of fraud such as newbalanceDest, oldbalanceOrg, and amount.
Evaluation: Assessed the model's performance using a classification report and ROC-AUC scores.

Future Work
Model Optimization: Further improve the model using techniques like Gradient Boosting or Neural Networks.
Real-Time Fraud Detection: Deploy the model for real-time fraud detection in financial systems.
Explainability: Incorporate explainability tools like SHAP to provide insights into how the model makes decisions.
